<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive malicious URL detection platform from scratch, iteratively adding features based on user feedback. Initially, the core request was to create an AI/ML-powered web platform for malicious URL detection, with a phased development plan. The engineer prioritized core scanning functionality, then expanded into advanced ML models, bulk processing, and enhanced analytics. A significant turn was adapting the platform to address e-skimming regulatory requirements, which involved specializing detection for payment gateways and adding compliance dashboards. Subsequently, the engineer integrated features similar to Sucuri SiteCheck, including multi-source blacklist checking, SSL certificate validation (and fixing an existing bug), security header analysis, and software vulnerability assessment. The most recent task involved adding a detailed report section with advanced SSL analysis (HackerTarget-style), SPF/DMARC/DKIM email security checks, and comprehensive threat assessment (IPQualityScore-style), which is currently in progress. The engineer effectively managed dependencies, environment variables, and UI updates, often using  for initial development and then  for incremental changes, and consistently used the  to validate progress.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested an AI/ML-powered web platform for detecting and analyzing malicious URLs, outlining a multi-phase development roadmap. The core problem addressed is identifying and analyzing threats from URLs to protect users and systems. The platform's features evolved through several iterations:
1.  **Core URL Scanning:** Detect malicious URLs using a combination of rule-based analysis and potential threat intelligence integration for phishing, malware, and general suspicious domains.
2.  **Advanced ML Models:** Incorporate deep learning for phishing, screenshot analysis with OCR (using open-source models), pattern recognition for campaign detection, and ensemble learning. This phase also included bulk URL scanning, enhanced analytics, email security integration, and advanced threat intelligence.
3.  **E-Skimming Protection & Regulatory Compliance:** Specifically address e-skimming risks for financial institutions (LFIs as Merchant Acquiring/Payment Aggregation Services) by performing daily scans for malware/malicious code on merchant and payment gateway URLs. The platform should detect payment detail compromises and recommend transaction halts for infected pages, adhering to the Retail Payment Services and Card Schemes Regulation.
4.  **Comprehensive Security Analysis (Sucuri/IPQualityScore/HackerTarget-like):** Add features like multi-source blacklist checking, accurate SSL certificate detection (with detailed info like expiry and issuer), security header analysis, software vulnerability assessment, SPF/DMARC/DKIM record checks, and a detailed, toggleable report showcasing these advanced analyses. Branding was also cleaned to remove emergent and Sucuri-like references, establishing SecureURL AI as the platform's identity.

<pending_tasks>
-   **DNS & Availability Checking**: Add a new section to the report showing if the link is online and if it's blocked by popular Free Public DNS Resolvers and Free Threat Intelligence / DNS Blocklist Providers.
-   **Screenshot analysis with Chrome Integration**: The screenshot functionality was disabled due to Chrome dependency issues (Chat Message 71). This feature needs to be re-enabled and properly integrated.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work before this summary request involved implementing a new section for DNS and availability checking. This feature aims to show whether a scanned URL is currently online and if it's blocked by a list of specified public DNS resolvers (e.g., Cloudflare, Quad9, Google DNS) and threat intelligence/DNS blocklist providers (e.g., SURBL, Spamhaus, AbuseIPDB).

The AI engineer has just initiated this task. The last action in the trajectory was: First, let me add the backend functionality for DNS resolver and availability checking:. This indicates that the current focus is on developing the backend logic to perform these checks (pinging URLs, querying DNS resolvers, checking against threat intelligence lists) and integrate the results into the existing URL analysis pipeline, likely within . The frontend () will then need updates to display this new information, potentially within the Detailed Security Report section.
